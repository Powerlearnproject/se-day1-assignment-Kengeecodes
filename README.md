Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science used in developing, testing and maintaining software
it is important because it allows for systems that are reliable, efficient and secure

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The era of structured programming and formal methods where in an error-prone industry there was need to tame complexity by emphasizing clear,logical control structures.
The adoption of the waterfall Model and process formalization where there was need to use more disciplined development hence encouraging process.
The rise of DevOps and continous where the industry has embraced automation, real-time monitoring and iterative improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- involves defining project goals and identifying the requirements of the project.
Requirements collection- detailed functional and non-functional requirements are collected from stakeholders.
Design- Creation of the system architetcure, user interface and data models.
Coding-Translatig the design into actual code using chosen programming language and tools.
Testing- Examining the code for bugs and defects.
Deployment- releasing the software to product environment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology-traditional, linear approach where each phase of the project is completed in sequence. It is more applicable where the projects have stable, well-defined requirements or infrastructure or construction projects and in highly regulated insudtries. The advantages and disadvantages include predictability where there are clearly defined milestones, deadlines and deliverables, extensive documentation that provides a detailed roadmap, risk management where the risks are identified early in the design phase, inflexibility because changes in requirements after the initial stages are difficult and costly to implement, delayed feedback as user feedback can only be achieved at the end.
Agile methodology involves a flexible and interactive approach that breaks work into small manageable increments called sprints.It is more applicable in software development in dynamic markets, innovative or experimental projects and projects requiring frequent user feedback. advantages are flexibility and adaptability, enhanced collaboration. disadvantages are it is less predictable, requires active stakeholder involvement and may lead to uncontrolled expansion of project if not well managed.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing clean, efficient and maintenable code, collaborating with other team members to create or refine system architecture, maintaining and updating software to ensure its functional.
a quality assurance engineer  plans tests and executions to ensure software meets quality standards, identifies and tracks bugs in a system, participates in providing feedback on systems for quality improvement and verifies that softwares meets the requirements and proper standards.
a project manager is tasked with developing project plans , team and stakeholders communication, identifies potential risks early and develops strategies to deal with the risks, tracks progresss to ensure the project stays within schedule and budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
INTERGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS (IDEs)-facilitate creation of software by providing space to write, compile and debug code, exmaples include Visual studio code, eclipse.
IDEs are an all-in-one toolset that combines a code editor, compiler, debugger and build automation tools within a single application.
IDEs enhance productivity  through features such as syntax highlighting,code completion,refractoring tools, and real time error detection that helps write cleaner, more maintenable code faster.
most IDEs allow seemless integration with external libraries , frameworks and version control systems so everything is manageable within one environment.
VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS(VCS)-are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
VCS tools enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase concurrently.
it allows tracking of changes and history of code and why changes were made.
integration with continous integration/continous deployment pipeline ensures that code is automatically tested and deployed as changes are committed
VCS allows for backup and recovery of the code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Evolving requirements and scope creep due to changing markets. this could be dealt with by adopting agile methdologies in development, regular stakeholder communication and clear documentation and change control.
Technical and code quality where shortcuts may lead to unamaintainable code and unsolvable bugs.this can be solved by implementing regular code reviews  and pair programming, establishing coding standards and automated testing
communication and collaboration challenge
keeping up with rapid technological changes.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- involves verifying individual units or components of code in isolation ensuring that each unit works correctly on its own before integrating it with other parts of the system
integration testing -focuses on verifying tat different units or modules of the software interact correctly.
System testing- it evaluates the complete and fully intergrated software product to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing-this is performed to determine whether the system meets the business requirement and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting, refining and optimizing the input instructions provided to an AI model in order to guide its outputs effectively.It allows for improved accuracy and relevance, enhanced control over output, efficient use of AI capabilities, reducing model hallucinations, facilitating rapid prototyping and iteration.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt " tell me about climate change"
improved prompt " provide a concise explanation of the main human- driven causes of climate change and describe two significant impacts on marine ecosystems"
the improved prompt has more clarity, is specific and concise.
